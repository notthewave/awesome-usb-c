# Awesome USB-C

This repo aims to be similar to:
- https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack
- https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices

For now it will just be a Markdown file.

Why is this project called `awesome-usb-c` and not awesome usb-4 or thunderbolt 3/4/5?
- Not all harware in this repo implements the full featureset of thunderbolt 5 or usb-4 2.0 for obvious reasons.

# Cables (Thunderbolt 5)

## What is Thunderbolt 5?

Thunderbolt 5 is an implementation of USB4 "80 Gbps". It mandates even higher minimum PCIe ("64 Gbps") and DP capabilities (2 DP tunnels, "6K60 each", unclear min. DP speed). It also mandates support for asymmetric 120/40 Gbit/s connections from hosts to docks, but does not mention the reverse. https://www.thunderbolttechnology.net/sites/default/files/TBT5%20Press%20Deck%20v3%20Final.pdf
